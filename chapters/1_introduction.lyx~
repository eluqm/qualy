Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physicians rely on medical images for patient screening, diagnosis and follow
 up examinations [4].
 Although there exist several approaches that use semantic image annotation,
 their implicit information cannot be automatically integrated into advanced
 medical applications such as for the clinical decision support.
 Traditionally, the grading (classification) of a tumor is determined by
 the evaluation of tumor characteristics by physicians [10].
 Having formal representations of grade definitions are necessary for applicatio
ns such as decision support for physicians.
 The staging information is paramount when clinicians assess an individual
 patient’s progress and decide on subsequent treatment steps [19].
 The method proposed here will provide pathologists with a robust tool,
 as a second opinion, for cancer grading, using the WHO grading system [10]
 [7].
 Problems during the interpretation of an image, such as lesion images annotated
 by dissimilar semantic terms that could be similar in appearance or lesion
 images that could be annotated by similar terms and may look visually dissimila
r, will be addressed.

Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatically grading of cancer lesions in medical images is done using
 semantic web reasoning technologies to process the image annotation metadata
 generated by programs, such as ePAD [13], to provide physicians with a
 second opinion on cancer grading.
 Currently, there are automatic cancer grading systems, however they are
 not open-source, their methods cannot be verified, and they also present
 precision problems [4].
 In the context of the classification process, the process of determining
 the grade of a tumor consists in checking if it meets a set of requirements[10]
 (we are going to use the WHO grading system [10] [7]).
 It is a classification task where background knowledge is necessary and,
 in the case of this work, this knowledge will be encoded in ontologies
 (in OWL) and rules (in SWRL).
